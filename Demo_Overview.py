    st.session_state['gemini_api_key'] = False

st.session_state['gemini_api_key'] = st.text_input('Gemini API Key')

if not st.session_state['gemini_api_key']:
    st.info('''
    Please add your Gemini API Key to Continue.
    If you don\'t have one, you can get an API key [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    ''')
    st.stop()
else:
    genai.configure(api_key=st.session_state['gemini_api_key'])
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

try:
    model.generate_content('hello')
    st.write('Valid API key, thank you.')
