'### Instructions'
'''
In order to run the demos, you'll need to input your API key:
'''
if 'gemini_api_key' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['gemini_api_key'] = False

st.session_state['gemini_api_key'] = st.text_input('Gemini API Key')

if not st.session_state['gemini_api_key']:
    st.info('''
    Please add your Gemini API Key to Continue.
    If you don\'t have one, you can get an API key [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    ''')
    st.stop()
else:
    genai.configure(api_key=st.session_state['gemini_api_key'])
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

try:
    st.markdown(model.generate_content('write: Valid API key, thank you.').text)
    st.session_state['can_run'] = True
    #time.sleep(2)
except:
    ('This is not a valid API key, please try again')
    st.stop()

'#### Please choose a demo from the sidebar on the left:'
