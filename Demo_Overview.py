In order to run the demos, you'll need to input your Google Cloud API key to run Gemini:
'''

# Prompt user to input API key.
if 'gemini_api_key' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['gemini_api_key'] = False

st.session_state['gemini_api_key'] = st.text_input('Gemini API Key', type='password')

if not st.session_state['gemini_api_key']:
    st.info('''
    Please add your API Key to Continue.
    If you don\'t have one, you can create a new API key [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    ''')
    st.stop()
else:
    genai.configure(api_key=st.session_state['gemini_api_key'])
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

# Test valid API key through successful model completion.
try:
    model.generate_content('hello')
    st.info('''
        Valid API key. Thank you.
        ''')
    st.write('\n')
    st.session_state['can_run'] = True
